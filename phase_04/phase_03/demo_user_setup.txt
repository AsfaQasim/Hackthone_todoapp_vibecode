"""
Simple guide to create a demo user in your database for testing purposes.

Since your backend uses SQLAlchemy and has a User model, you can create a demo user manually:

1. Connect to your database using a database management tool
2. Insert a record into the "user" table with these values:
   - email: demo@example.com
   - name: Demo User
   - password: (hashed version of "demo123")

For testing purposes, you can use this plain text password temporarily:
   - Email: demo@example.com
   - Password: demo123

Note: In production, passwords should always be properly hashed using bcrypt or similar.
