Subject: Request to unblock repository after removing secrets

Hello GitHub Support Team,

I am the owner of the repository:
https://github.com/AsfaQasim/Hackthone_todoapp_vibecode

My repository is currently blocked from accepting pushes due to secret scanning detection with the error:
"push declined due to repository rule violations"

I have taken the following remediation steps:

1. Removed all sensitive files (.env files, API keys, JWT secrets) from the codebase
2. Added comprehensive .gitignore to prevent future commits of sensitive files
3. Created .env.example files with placeholder values for documentation
4. Used git-filter-repo to remove secrets from entire git history
5. All exposed secrets have been rotated and regenerated

The repository now only contains:
- Application source code
- Documentation files
- Example configuration files (no real secrets)
- Docker deployment configurations

I understand the importance of keeping secrets out of version control and have implemented proper security measures going forward.

Could you please review and unblock my repository so I can push my cleaned codebase?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
